# Risk-Modeling-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
CFI-BIDA Program Course detailing how to model risk using Monte Carlo Simulation in Python
Monte Carlo simulation aid us in understanding the risk of uncertainity in prediction and forecasting models. Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to forcast stock prices.


## Learning Objectives
1. Use historical observations to estimate the probability distributions of data
2. Simulate many possible outcomes for independent variables using Python
3. Summarize the distribution of secnarios using confidence intervals
4. Interpret the output of Monte Carlo Simulation results and use it to guide business decisions

### Case Studies Illustrated using Monte Carlo Simulation
1. Coin flipping model
2. Stock price model
3. Value at risk model
4. Net profit model
5. Capital investment NPV model
